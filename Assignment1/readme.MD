Steps to Run Assignment:
1. Extract 22111014_Assignment1.zip in your local system. Then extract the tokens file and token_dict file {7 zip recommended}. These file contain tokens and their frequencies and all the further processing will be done after importing them.
2. Open Assingment1.ipynb file in your idle environment. Change the data path according to your file location(second cell).
3. Run according to below Question instruction and information.

Additional Information:

Question1: I defined function for unicode correction named unicode.To check its accuracy call function unicode with a word {that needs to be tested} as a parameter and it will return unicode_corrected version of that word.

Question2: Don't execute the first cell just after the question2 instead of it just execute the next cell to get the tokens.{as stated in the notebook}
To test the correctness of syllable function in change the code line for token in tokens to for token in ['The word you want to test'].

Question3: Since BPE alogrithm takes too much time that why i have created a pickle file beforehand that contains BPE token. SO instead of running BPE algorithm just run the import pickle cell.

Question 5: Change the path according to your file Location of conllu files. I are using all three dev, train, test files.

Question 6: Red dotted line shows the Expected Zifian.



**ALL other required EXplanation are provided in the notebook itself.**
